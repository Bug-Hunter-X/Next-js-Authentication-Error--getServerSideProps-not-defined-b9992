# Next.js Authentication Error: getServerSideProps not defined

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications related to authentication and the use of `getServerSideProps`. The error occurs when a page attempts to access `getServerSideProps` in a context where it's not defined, such as when the page is rendered on the client-side.

## Problem

The provided code demonstrates a scenario where the `/about` page attempts to utilize `getServerSideProps` for user authentication. However, this function is not available in the context of the client-side rendering of the page. This leads to a runtime error.

## Solution

The solution involves moving the authentication logic to a separate component or function that can be called from within the page. This component will handle the check for user authentication before rendering the page content. The solution also illustrates a more robust implementation of the `getServerSideProps` function, making the authentication logic more flexible and scalable.
